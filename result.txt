document:  OBJECTIVE: This retrospective chart review describes the epidemiology and clinical features of 40 patients with culture-proven Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Patients with positive M. pneumoniae cultures from respiratory specimens from January 1997 through December 1998 were identified through the Microbiology records. Charts of patients were reviewed. RESULTS: 40 patients were identified, 33 (82.5%) of whom required admission. Most infections (92.5%) were community-acquired. The infection affected all age groups but was most common in infants (32.5%) and pre-school children (22.5%). It occurred year-round but was most common in the fall (35%) and spring (30%). More than three-quarters of patients (77.5%) had comorbidities. Twenty-four isolates (60%) were associated with pneumonia, 14 (35%) with upper respiratory tract infections, and 2 (5%) with bronchiolitis. Cough (82.5%), fever (75%), and malaise (58.8%) were the most common symptoms, and crepitations (60%), and wheezes (40%) were the most common signs. Most patients with pneumonia had crepitations (79.2%) but only 25% had bronchial breathing. Immunocompromised patients were more likely than non-immunocompromised patients to present with pneumonia (8/9 versus 16/31, P = 0.05). Of the 24 patients with pneumonia, 14 (58.3%) had uneventful recovery, 4 (16.7%) recovered following some complications, 3 (12.5%) died because of M pneumoniae infection, and 3 (12.5%) died due to underlying comorbidities. The 3 patients who died of M pneumoniae pneumonia had other comorbidities. CONCLUSION: our results were similar to published data except for the finding that infections were more common in infants and preschool children and that the mortality rate of pneumonia in patients with comorbidities was high.

Abstract The objective of the study was to determine the level of Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) of patients attended dental clinics at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH) regarding cross infections and infection control in dentistry. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 225 patients who attended the dental clinics of KAUH, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 2014. A standardized, confidential, anonymous, interviewing questionnaire was used. Knowledge about dental infections was assessed by 12 MCQs. The attitudes were assessed through answering seven statements on a three- point Likert scale. Patients’ self reported practices were also evaluated. Descriptive and inferential statistics were done. Results of the study revealed that 39.5%, 38.7% and 21.8% of the participants obtained poor, fair and satisfactory level of knowledge about infections and infection control in dentistry, respectively. Social media was the commonest source of information about dental infection. Participant's educational level was significantly associated with the level of knowledge about dental infection. Patients had positive attitudes towards infection control in dentistry. Regarding self-reported practice, only few participants would ask dentists about sterilization of dental instruments (9.3%), wearing face mask (13.3%) and gloves (16.4%) if they don’t do so. In conclusion, our participants had good attitudes towards infection control in dentistry. However, their knowledge and practice need improvements. Conduction of educational programs is needed through social media, mass media, schools and public places. These programs involve both patients and providers.
PURPOSE: Community-acquired pneumonia is a common illness worldwide. In adults, community-acquired bacterial pneumonia has been well studied, but viral pneumonia is less well understood. We designed this study to identify respiratory pathogens, including common pneumonia-causing bacteria, viruses and atypical pneumonia pathogens, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia at the Fever Clinic of Peking University Third Hospital. We collected sputum or throat swabs from patients diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. Multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed for 20 pathogens, including 9 viruses, 3 atypical pathogens and 8 bacteria. RESULTS: There were 232 outpatients enrolled in our study, and 153 patients (65.9%) had positive test results, of which 26.7% were viruses, 19.4% were atypical pathogens and 19.8% were bacteria. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was detected at the highest frequency (19.0%), exceeding Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. The most commonly identified viral pathogens were IFVs (15.1%), PIVs (3.4%) and RhV (2.6%). The most commonly identified bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.1%), Haemophilus influenza (6.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.6%). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that viruses were commonly detected in outpatients with CAP, and IFVs were the most common viruses, especially during flu season. Patients with viral infection were prone to viral-bacterial coinfection. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the leading pathogen in the outpatients with CAP. Viral infection occurs in a large number of outpatients with CAP, and it should receive greater attention in clinical work.

document:  Inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract are commonly associated with elevated production of nitric oxide (NO•) and increased indices of NO• -dependent oxidative stress. Although NO• is known to have anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, various lines of evidence support the contribution of NO• to lung injury in several disease models. On the basis of biochemical evidence, it is often presumed that such NO• -dependent oxidations are due to the formation of the oxidant peroxynitrite, although alternative mechanisms involving the phagocyte-derived heme proteins myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase might be operative during conditions of inflammation. Because of the overwhelming literature on NO• generation and activities in the respiratory tract, it would be beyond the scope of this commentary to review this area comprehensively. Instead, it focuses on recent evidence and concepts of the presumed contribution of NO• to inflammatory diseases of the lung.

Suicidal behavior is complex and manifests because of a confluence of diverse factors. One such factor involves dysregulation of the immune system, which has been linked to the pathophysiology of suicidal behavior. This review will provide a brief description of suicidality and discuss the contribution of upstream and downstream factors in the etiology of suicidal behavior, within the contextual framework of inflammation. The contribution of inflammatory conditions such as traumatic brain injury, autoimmune disorders, and infections to neuropsychiatric symptoms and suicidality is only beginning to be explored. We will summarize studies of inflammation in the etiology of suicide, and provide a neurobiological basis for different mechanisms by which inflammation might contribute to the pathophysiology. Finally, we will review treatments that affect upstream and downstream pathways related to inflammation in suicidality.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was recently declared a worldwide pandemic. Infection triggers the respiratory tract disease COVID-19, which is accompanied by serious changes of clinical biomarkers such as hemoglobin and interleukins. The same parameters are altered during hemolysis, which is characterized by an increase in labile heme. We present two approaches that aim at analyzing a potential link between available heme and COVID-19 pathogenesis. Four COVID-19 related proteins, i.e. the host cell proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as well as the viral protein 7a and S protein, were identified as potential heme binders. We also performed a detailed analysis of the common pathways induced by heme and SARS-CoV-2 by superimposition of knowledge graphs covering heme biology and COVID-19 pathophysiology. Herein, focus was laid on inflammatory pathways, and distinct biomarkers as the linking elements. Finally, the results substantially improve our understanding of COVID-19 infections and disease progression of patients with different clinical backgrounds and expand the diagnostic and treatment options.

document:  Surfactant protein-D (SP-D) participates in the innate response to inhaled microorganisms and organic antigens, and contributes to immune and inflammatory regulation within the lung. SP-D is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. SP-D, a collagenous calcium-dependent lectin (or collectin), binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms, and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens. SP-D also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. In addition, SP-D binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. Consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that SP-D-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids, and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of SP-D-deficient mice is altered, and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and/or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema. The expression of SP-D is increased in response to many forms of lung injury, and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized SP-D might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases.

The collectin surfactant protein-D (SP-D) plays a significant role in innate immunity. Epidemiological studies described associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the human gene coding surfactant protein-D (SFTPD) and infectious pulmonary diseases. Studies on twins indicated very strong genetic dependence for serum levels of SP-D. The aim of this study was to determine the genetic influence of sequence variations within the SFTPD gene on the constitutional serum SP-D levels. We sequenced the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR), the coding region and the 3′ region of the SFTPD gene of 32 randomly selected blood donors. Six validated SNPs were genotyped with sequence-specific probes (TaqMan 7000) in 290 German blood donors. Serum SP-D levels were analysed by ELISA, and the association of SFTPD haplotype estimates with the quantitative phenotype serum SP-D level was determined. One single SFTPD haplotype (allele frequency 13.53%) revealed a negative association with serum SP-D levels (P<0.0001). This was confirmed in a second prospectively collected group of blood donors (n=160, P=0.0034). The discovery of a frequent negative variant of the SFTPD gene provides a basis for genetic analysis of the function of SP-D in the resistance against pulmonary infections and inflammatory disorders in humans.
Surfactant treatment is one of the milestones of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) treatment in preterm infants, but it has been also demonstrated to exert consistent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Exogenous natural surfactant contains antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and nonenzymatic antioxidant molecules, such as plasmalogens and polyunsaturated phospholipids (PUPLs). Moreover, surfactant can contribute to the modulation of intra-alveolar inflammatory processes through the regulation effect of the surfactant A (SP-A) and B (SP-B) proteins. Although less extensively investigated, these functions may contribute to the efficacy of exogenous surfactant administration in preterm neonates with RDS.

Global biosecurity threats such as the spread of emerging infectious diseases (i.e., avian influenza, SARS, Hendra, Nipah, etc.) and bioterrorism have generated significant interest in recent years. There is considerable effort directed towards understanding and negating the proliferation of infectious diseases. Biosensors are an attractive tool which have the potential to detect the outbreak of a virus and/or disease. Although there is a host of technologies available, either commercially or in the scientific literature, the development of biosensors for the detection of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) is still in its infancy. There is no doubt that the glucose biosensor, the gene chip, the protein chip, etc. have all played and are still playing a significant role in monitoring various biomolecules. Can biosensors play an important role for the detection of emerging infectious diseases? What does the future hold and which biosensor technology platform is suitable for the real-time detection of infectious diseases? These and many other questions will be addressed in this review. The purpose of this review is to present an overview of biosensors particularly in relation to EIDs. It provides a synopsis of the various types of biosensor technologies that have been used to detect EIDs, and describes some of the technologies behind them in terms of transduction and bioreceptor principles.
Are pathogens in outdoor air a health issue at present or will they become a problem in the future? A working group called AirPath - Outdoor Environments and Human Pathogens in Air was set up in 2007 at University College London, UK with the aim of opening new discussion and creating a research network to investigate the science and impacts of outdoor pathogens. Our objective in this paper is to review and discuss the following areas: What is the source of human pathogens in outdoor air? What current, developing and future techniques do we need? Can we identify at-risk groups in relation to their activities and environments? How do we prepare for the anticipated challenges of environmental change and new and emerging diseases? And how can we control for and prevent pathogens in outdoor environments? We think that this work can benefit the wider research community and policy makers by providing a concise overview of various research aspects and considerations which may be important to their work.

document:  Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) are viruses of the family Paramyxoviridae, subfamily pneumovirus, which cause clinically important respiratory infections in humans and rodents, respectively. The respiratory epithelial target cells respond to viral infection with specific alterations in gene expression, including production of chemoattractant cytokines, adhesion molecules, elements that are related to the apoptosis response, and others that remain incompletely understood. Here we review our current understanding of these mucosal responses and discuss several genomic approaches, including differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene array strategies, that will permit us to unravel the nature of these responses in a more complete and systematic manner.

The recognition that bacterial infections induce signal transduction responses in infected epithelial cells also provides new avenues to consider as novel forms of therapy. For example, the chemokine interleukin-8, which attracts neutrophils to sites of mucosal infection, is produced by epithelial cells of gastric and intestinal origin in response to bacterial infection. Inhibitors of chemokine production or inhibition of the biologic effects of neutrophil chemoattractants have the potential to reduce both mucosal inflammatory responses and the attendant clinical sequelae. Eukaryotic cells also respond to infection with elevations in cytosolic second messengers, including inositol triphosphate (IP3) and calcium ([Ca2+]i). In intestinal epithelium, these second messengers can mediate the diarrheal response to infection. Calcium/calmodulin inhibitors may have a beneficial effect in treating those gastrointestinal infections mediated through changes in the level of cytosolic free calcium. DuPont and colleagues showed, for example, that oral therapy with zaldaride maleate relieves symptoms of disease and shortens the duration of diarrhea in travelers with ETEC-induced diarrhea. Evaluation of additional signal transduction responses to microbial infections should provide both new insights into the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal infectious diseases and novel approaches to consider for the prevention and therapy for these human illnesses.
Viruses that infect the lung are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in animals and humans worldwide. Coronaviruses are being associated increasingly with severe diseases in the lower respiratory tract. Alveolar epithelial cells are an important target for coronavirus infection in the lung, and infected cells can initiate innate immune responses to viral infection. In this overview, we describe in vitro models of highly differentiated alveolar epithelial cells that are currently being used to study the innate immune response to coronavirus infection. We have shown that rat coronavirus infection of rat alveolar type I epithelial cells in vitro induces expression of CXC chemokines, which may recruit and activate neutrophils. Although neutrophils are recruited early in infection in several coronavirus models including rat coronavirus. However, their role in viral clearance and/or immune-mediated tissue damage is not understood. Primary cultures of differentiated alveolar epithelial cells will be useful for identifying the interactions between coronaviruses and alveolar epithelial cells that influence the innate immune responses to infection in the lung. Understanding the molecular details of these interactions will be critical for the design of effective strategies to prevent and treat coronavirus infections in the lung.

document:  Nidovirus subgenomic mRNAs contain a leader sequence derived from the 5′ end of the genome fused to different sequences (‘bodies’) derived from the 3′ end. Their generation involves a unique mechanism of discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis that resembles copy-choice RNA recombination. During this process, the nascent RNA strand is transferred from one site in the template to another, during either plus or minus strand synthesis, to yield subgenomic RNA molecules. Central to this process are transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs), which are present at both template sites and ensure the fidelity of strand transfer. Here we present results of a comprehensive co-variation mutagenesis study of equine arteritis virus TRSs, demonstrating that discontinuous RNA synthesis depends not only on base pairing between sense leader TRS and antisense body TRS, but also on the primary sequence of the body TRS. While the leader TRS merely plays a targeting role for strand transfer, the body TRS fulfils multiple functions. The sequences of mRNA leader–body junctions of TRS mutants strongly suggested that the discontinuous step occurs during minus strand synthesis.

Coronaviruses contain an unusually long (27-32,000 ribonucleotide) positive sense RNA genome that is polyadenylated at the 3' end and capped at the 5' end. In addition to the genome, infected cells contain subgenomic mRNAs that form a 3' co-terminal nested set with the genome. In addition to their common 3' ends, the genome and the subgenomic mRNAs contain an identical 5' leader sequence. The transcription mechanism that coronaviruses use to produce subgenomic mRNA is not known and has been the subject of speculation since sequencing of the subgenomic mRNAs showed they must arise by discontinuous transcription. The current model called leader-primed transcription has subgenomic mRNAs transcribed directly from genome-length negative strands. It was based on the failure to find in coronavirus infected cells subgenome-length negative strands or replication intermediates containing subgenome-length negative strands. Clearly, these structures exist in infected cells and are transcriptionally active. We proposed a new model for coronavirus transcription which we called 3' discontinuous extension of negative strands. This model predicts that subgenome-length negative strands would be derived directly by transcription using the genome RNA as a template. The subgenome-length templates would contain the common 5' leader sequence and serve as templates for the production of subgenomic mRNAs. Our findings include showing that: 1. Replication intermediates (RIs) containing subgenome-length RNA exist in infected cells and are separable from RIs with genome-length templates. The RFs with subgenome-length templates are not derived by RNase treatment of RIs with genome-length templates. 2. The subgenome-length negative strands are formed early in infection when RIs are accumulating and the rate of viral RNA synthesis is increasing exponentially. 3. Subgenome-length negative strands contain at their 3' ends a complementary copy of the 72 nucleotide leader RNA that is found in the genome only at their 5' end. 4. RIs with subgenomic templates serve immediately as templates for transcription of subgenomic mRNAs. Because subgenomic mRNAs are not replicated, i.e., copied into negative strands that in turn are used as templates for subgenomic mRNA synthesis, we propose that the subgenome-length negative strands must arise directly by transcription of the genome and acquire their common 3' anti-leader sequence after polymerase jumping from the intergenic regions to the leader sequence at the 5' end of the genome. This would make negative strand synthesis discontinuous and subgenomic mRNA synthesis continuous, which is the opposite of what was proposed in the leader primed model.
Nidoviruses produce an extensive 3'-coterminal nested set of subgenomic mRNAs, which are used to express their structural proteins. In addition, arterivirus and coronavirus mRNAs contain a common 5' leader sequence, derived from the genomic 5' end. The joining of this leader sequence to different segments (mRNA bodies) from the genomic 3'-proximal region presumably involves a unique mechanism of discontinuous minus-strand RNA synthesis. Key elements in this process are the so-called transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs), which determine a base-pairing interaction between sense and antisense viral RNA that is essential for leader-to-body joining. To identify RNA structures in the 5'-proximal region of the equine arteritis virus genome that may be involved in subgenomic mRNA synthesis, a detailed secondary RNA structure model was established using bioinformatics, phylogenetic analysis, and RNA structure probing. According to this structure model, the leader TRS is located in the loop of a prominent hairpin (leader TRS hairpin; LTH). The importance of the LTH was supported by the results of a mutagenesis study using an EAV molecular clone. Besides evidence for a direct role of the LTH in subgenomic RNA synthesis, indications for a role of the LTH region in genome replication and/or translation were obtained. Similar LTH structures could be predicted for the 5'-proximal region of all arterivirus genomes and, interestingly, also for most coronaviruses. Thus, we postulate that the LTH is a key structural element in the discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis and is likely critical for leader TRS function.

document:  Recent evidence suggests that critically ill patients are able to tolerate lower levels of haemoglobin than was previously believed. It is our goal to show that transfusing to a level of 100 g/l does not improve mortality and other clinically important outcomes in a critical care setting. Although many questions remain, many laboratory and clinical studies, including a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), have established that transfusing to normal haemoglobin concentrations does not improve organ failure and mortality in the critically ill patient. In addition, a restrictive transfusion strategy will reduce exposure to allogeneic transfusions, result in more efficient use of red blood cells (RBCs), save blood overall, and decrease health care costs.

Sleep quality of patients in intensive care unit (ICU) has been recently recognized as an important aspect of the intensive care. Dexmedetomidine is one of the most recently introduced for sedation in the ICU. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on sleep quality of patients without mechanical ventilation in ICU.The patients who were included in this study were divided into two groups. In the sedation group, dexmedetomidine was given by a continuous infusion targeting a sedation level -1 to -2 on the score of RASS (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale). In the no sedation group, the patients slept by themselves. No other sedatives were given. Bispectral Index (BIS) was performed on these hemodynamically stable critically ill patients for 12 consecutive hours. Sleep time and sleep depth were recorded.Twenty patients were studied. Compared to no sedation group, sleep efficiency and sleep time of patients in the sedation group was significantly higher during the night. Moreover, there was no significantly difference between the changes of blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate.Dexmedetomidine is a clinically effective and safe sedative for the highly selected critically ill patients without endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation in the ICU to increases total sleep time and improve sleep efficiency.
BACKGROUND: Recently, continuous administration of piperacillin-tazobactam has been proposed as a valuable alternative to traditional intermittent administration especially in critically ill patients. However, antibiotic dosing remains a challenge for clinicians as antibiotic dosing regimens are usually determined in non-critically ill hospitalized adult patients. The aim was to conduct a systematic review to identify and highlight studies comparing clinical outcomes of piperacillin tazobactam dosing regimens, continuous/prolonged infusion vs intermittent infusion in critically ill patients. Meta-analyses were performed to assess the overall effect of dosing regimen on clinical efficacy. METHODS: Studies were identified systematically through searches of PubMed and Science Direct, in compliance with PRISMA guidelines. Following the systematic literature review, meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were included in the analysis involving 3828 critically ill adult participants in total (continuous/prolonged infusion = 2197 and intermittent infusion = 1631) from geographically diverse regions. Continuous/prolonged resulted in significantly: higher clinical cure rates (Odds Ratio 1.56, 95% Confidence Interval 1.28–1.90, P = 0 .0001), lower mortality rates (Odds Ratio 0.68, 95% Confidence Interval 0.55–0.84, P = 0 .0003), higher microbiological success rates (Odds Ratio 1.52, 95% Confidence Interval 1.10–2.11, P = 0.01) and decreasing the length of hospital stay (Mean Difference − 1.27, 95% Confidence Interval − 2.45—0.08, P = 0.04) in critically ill patients. CONCLUSION: Results from this study show that there is a significant level of evidence that clinical outcome in critically ill patients is improved in patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam via continuous/prolonged infusion. However, more rigorous scientific studies in critically ill patients are warranted to reach a sufficient level of evidence and promote further implementation of C/PI as a dosing strategy.

document:  Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an inducible stress protein, confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. In addition to its physiological role in heme degradation, HO-1 may influence a number of cellular processes, including growth, inflammation, and apoptosis. By virtue of anti-inflammatory effects, HO-1 limits tissue damage in response to proinflammatory stimuli and prevents allograft rejection after transplantation. The transcriptional upregulation of HO-1 responds to many agents, such as hypoxia, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. HO-1 and its constitutively expressed isozyme, heme oxygenase-2, catalyze the rate-limiting step in the conversion of heme to its metabolites, bilirubin IXα, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide (CO). The mechanisms by which HO-1 provides protection most likely involve its enzymatic reaction products. Remarkably, administration of CO at low concentrations can substitute for HO-1 with respect to anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, suggesting a role for CO as a key mediator of HO-1 function. Chronic, low-level, exogenous exposure to CO from cigarette smoking contributes to the importance of CO in pulmonary medicine. The implications of the HO-1/CO system in pulmonary diseases will be discussed in this review, with an emphasis on inflammatory states.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical for instructing immune responses toward inflammatory or anti-inflammatory status. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is known for its cytoprotective effect against oxidative stress and inflammation, suggesting its immune regulatory role in allergic lung inflammation. HO-1 has been implicated in affecting DC maturation; however, its role in DC-mediated T-cell differentiation is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that HO-1-expressing bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs) displayed tolerogenic phenotypes, including their resistance to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced maturation, high level expression of IL-10, and low T-cell stimulatory activity. In addition, HO-1-expressing DCs were able to induce antigen-specific Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Also, HO-1-expressing DCs modulated the severity of lung inflammatory responses in two murine models of airway inflammation. This study provided evidence supporting the role of HO-1-expressing DCs in tolerance induction and as a potential therapeutic target for allergic asthma as well as other inflammatory diseases.
The role of genetic factors in the modulation of serum bilirubin levels and the pathophysiology of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is being increasingly recognized. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is the rate-limiting enzyme by which heme is catabolized to biliverdin and thence to bilirubin, with the simultaneous release of equimolar quantities of ferrous iron (Fe3+) and carbon monoxide. Polymorphisms of the HO-1 gene promoter may modulate transcriptional activity, thereby augmenting or attenuating HO-1 expression with resultant modulation of the production of bilirubin. Few studies have related these polymorphisms to neonatal bilirubin metabolism and have reported conflicting results. In this clinical review, we surveyed the role of HO-1 gene promoter polymorphisms in the control of bilirubin production and further considered their role, if any, in the pathophysiology of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

document:  This report describes the design and implementation of the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) system, a computer-based public health surveillance system for early detection of disease outbreaks. Hospitals send RODS data from clinical encounters over virtual private networks and leased lines using the Health Level 7 (HL7) message protocol. The data are sent in real time. RODS automatically classifies the registration chief complaint from the visit into one of seven syndrome categories using Bayesian classifiers. It stores the data in a relational database, aggregates the data for analysis using data warehousing techniques, applies univariate and multivariate statistical detection algorithms to the data, and alerts users of when the algorithms identify anomalous patterns in the syndrome counts. RODS also has a Web-based user interface that supports temporal and spatial analyses. RODS processes sales of over-the-counter health care products in a similar manner but receives such data in batch mode on a daily basis. RODS was used during the 2002 Winter Olympics and currently operates in two states—Pennsylvania and Utah. It has been and continues to be a resource for implementing, evaluating, and applying new methods of public health surveillance.

BACKGROUND: With international concern over emerging infectious diseases (EID) and bioterrorist attacks, public health is being required to have early outbreak detection systems. A disease surveillance team was organized to establish a hospital emergency department-based syndromic surveillance system (ED-SSS) capable of automatically transmitting patient data electronically from the hospitals responsible for emergency care throughout the country to the Centers for Disease Control in Taiwan (Taiwan-CDC) starting March, 2004. This report describes the challenges and steps involved in developing ED-SSS and the timely information it provides to improve in public health decision-making. METHODS: Between June 2003 and March 2004, after comparing various surveillance systems used around the world and consulting with ED physicians, pediatricians and internal medicine physicians involved in infectious disease control, the Syndromic Surveillance Research Team in Taiwan worked with the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh to create Taiwan's ED-SSS. The system was evaluated by analyzing daily electronic ED data received in real-time from the 189 hospitals participating in this system between April 1, 2004 and March 31, 2005. RESULTS: Taiwan's ED-SSS identified winter and summer spikes in two syndrome groups: influenza-like illnesses and respiratory syndrome illnesses, while total numbers of ED visits were significantly higher on weekends, national holidays and the days of Chinese lunar new year than weekdays (p < 0.001). It also identified increases in the upper, lower, and total gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome groups starting in November 2004 and two clear spikes in enterovirus-like infections coinciding with the two school semesters. Using ED-SSS for surveillance of influenza-like illnesses and enteroviruses-related infections has improved Taiwan's pandemic flu preparedness and disease control capabilities. CONCLUSION: Taiwan's ED-SSS represents the first nationwide real-time syndromic surveillance system ever established in Asia. The experiences reported herein can encourage other countries to develop their own surveillance systems. The system can be adapted to other cultural and language environments for better global surveillance of infectious diseases and international collaboration.
In September 2004, Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox and Addington (KFL and A) Public Health, in collaboration with the Public Health Division of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Queen's University, the Public Health Agency of Canada, Kingston General Hospital and Hotel Dieu Hospital, began a 2-year pilot project to implement and evaluate an emergency department (ED) chief complaint syndromic surveillance system. Our objective was to evaluate a comprehensive and readily deployable real-time regional syndromic surveillance program and to determine its ability to detect gastrointestinal or respiratory outbreaks well in advance of traditional reporting systems. In order to implement the system, modifications were made to the University of Pittsburgh's Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) system, which has been successfully integrated into public health systems, and has enhanced communication and collaboration between them and EDs. This paper provides an overview of a RODS-based syndromic surveillance system as adapted for use at a public health unit in Kingston, Ontario. We summarize the technical specifications, privacy and security considerations, data capture, classification and management of the data streams, alerting and public health response. We hope that the modifications described here, including the addition of unique data streams, will provide a benchmark for future Canadian syndromic surveillance systems.
